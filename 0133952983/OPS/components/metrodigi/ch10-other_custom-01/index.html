                        <p>Emerging early childhood research shows that each parent/caregiver plays a unique role in a child's development. Although "mothers" tend to be women and "fathers" tend to be men, research also shows that the gender of the caregiver is less important than the actual way they interact with their children.</p><p>For example, the "mother" role involves protecting and cheerleading (supporting) the child, while the "father" role involves encouraging the child to take risks and do challenging things. The main conclusion of this research on parental roles is that mothers and fathers (or caregivers who play these roles) are both vital to raising a healthy, well-adjusted child.</p>
                        <p>This survey asks you about your attitudes towards and experiences with the father figure(s) in your life (no matter what their gender or actual biological relationship to you) and how the role they've played in your life has affected your life-span development.</p>
