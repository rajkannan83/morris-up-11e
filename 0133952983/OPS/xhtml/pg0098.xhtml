Acquaintances describe Jay in glowing terms, saying she is highly motivated, intelligent, attractive, and charming. But Jay feels terribly insecure and anxious. When the psychologist asked her to pick out some self-descriptive adjectives, she selected “introverted,” “shy,” “inadequate,” and “unhappy.”</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001638A" data-uri="M10_MORR8923_11_SE_C10.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001638A">Jay was the firstborn in a family of two boys and one girl. Her father is a quiet, gentle medical researcher. His work often allowed him to study at home, so he had extensive contact with his children when they were young. He loved all his children, but clearly favored Jay. His ambitions and goals for her were extremely high; and as she matured, he responded to her every need and demand almost immediately and with full conviction. Their relationship remains as close today as it was during Jay’s childhood.</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001638B" data-uri="M10_MORR8923_11_SE_C10.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001638B">Jay’s mother worked long hours away from home as a store manager and consequently saw her children primarily at night and on an occasional free weekend. When she came home, Mrs. Smith was tired and had little energy for “nonessential” interactions with her children. She had always been career oriented, but she experienced considerable conflict and frustration trying to reconcile her roles as mother, housekeeper, and financial provider. Mrs. Smith was usually amiable toward all her children but tended to argue more with Jay, until the bickering subsided when Jay was about 6 or 7 years of age. Today, their relationship is cordial but lacks the closeness apparent between Jay and Dr. Smith. Interactions between Dr. and Mrs. Smith were sometimes marred by stormy outbursts over seemingly trivial matters. These episodes were always followed by periods of mutual silence lasting for days.</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001638C" data-uri="M10_MORR8923_11_SE_C10.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001638C">Jay was very jealous of her first brother, born when she was 2 years old. Her parents recall that Jay sometimes staged temper tantrums when the new infant demanded and received a lot of attention (especially from Mrs. Smith). The temper tantrums intensified when Jay’s second brother was born, just 1 year later. As time passed, the brothers formed an alliance to try to undermine Jay’s supreme position with their father. Jay only became closer to her father, and her relationships with her brothers were marked by greater-than-average jealousy and rivalry from early childhood to the present.</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001638D" data-uri="M10_MORR8923_11_SE_C10.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001638D">Throughout elementary, junior high, and high school, Jay was popular and did well academically. Early on, she decided on a career in medicine. Yet, off and on between the ages of 8 and 17, she had strong feelings of loneliness, depression, insecurity, and confusion—feelings common enough during this age period, but stronger than in most youngsters and very distressing to Jay.</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001638E" data-uri="M10_MORR8923_11_SE_C10.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001638E">Jay’s college days were a period of great personal growth, but several unsuccessful romantic involvements caused her much pain. The failure to achieve a stable and long-lasting relationship persisted after college and troubled Jay greatly. Although even-tempered in most circumstances, Jay often had an explosive fit of anger that ended each important romantic relationship that she had. “What is wrong with me?” she would ask herself. “Why do I find it impossible to maintain a serious relationship for any length of time?”</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001638F" data-uri="M10_MORR8923_11_SE_C10.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001638F">In medical school, her conflicts crept into her consciousness periodically: “I don’t deserve to be a doctor”; “I won’t pass my exams”; “Who am I, and what do I want from life?”</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000016390" data-uri="M10_MORR8923_11_SE_C10.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000016390">How can we describe and understand Jaylene Smith’s personality? How did she become who she is? Why does she feel insecure and uncertain despite her obvious success? Why do her friends see her as charming and attractive, though she describes herself as introverted and inadequate? These are the kinds of questions that <span class="pagebreak" title="355" id="P70004931900000000000000000042F7" data-uri="M10_MORR8923_11_SE_C10.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000042F7" epub:type="pagebreak"/>personality psychologists are likely to ask about Jay—and the kinds of questions we will try to answer in this chapter.</p></aside>

The very concept of personality implies that our behavior differs in significant ways from that of other people (<i>Diversity–Universality</i>) and that our behavior in part reflects our personality as opposed to the situations in which we find ourselves (<i>Person–Situation</i>). We will also assess the extent to which personality is a result of inheritance, rather than a reflection of life experiences (<i>Nature–Nurture</i>). Finally, we will consider the extent to which personality changes as we grow older (<i>Stability–Change</i>).</p></section></section>
