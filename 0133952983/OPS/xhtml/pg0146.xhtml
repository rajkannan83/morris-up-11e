<p id="P70004931900000000000000000173A4" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000173A4">An attitude has three major components: <i>evaluative beliefs</i> about an object, <i>feelings</i> about that object, and <i>behavior tendencies</i> toward that object. Beliefs include facts, opinions, and our general knowledge. Feelings encompass love, hate, like, dislike, and similar sentiments. Behavior tendencies refer to our inclinations to act in certain ways toward the object—to approach it, avoid it, and so on. For example, our attitude toward a political candidate includes our beliefs about the candidate’s qualifications and positions on crucial issues and our expectations about how the candidate will vote on those issues. We also have feelings about the candidate—like or dislike, trust or mistrust. And because of these beliefs and feelings, we are inclined to behave in certain ways toward the candidate—to vote for or against the candidate, to contribute time or money to the candidate’s campaign, to make a point of attending or staying away from rallies for the candidate, and so forth.</p>
<p id="P70004931900000000000000000173A5" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000173A5">As we will see shortly, these three aspects of an attitude are often consistent with one another. For example, if we have positive feelings toward something, we tend to have positive beliefs about it and to behave positively toward it. This tendency does not mean, however, that our every action will accurately reflect our attitudes. For example, our feelings about going to dentists may be negative, yet most of us make an annual visit anyway. Let’s look more closely at the relationship between attitudes and behavior.</p>

Then they try to meet those “demands,” rather than behave according to their own beliefs or sentiments. In contrast, those who score low in self-monitoring express and act on their attitudes with great consistency, showing relatively little regard for situational clues or constraints.</p><aside class="marginalia" id="P7000493190000000000000000005B60" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005B60"><section class="glossary" id="P7000493190000000000000000005B61" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005B61" epub:type="glossary"><dl class="glossentrylist" id="P70004931900000000000000000173A8" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000173A8"><dt class="glossterm" id="P7000493190000000000000000005B63" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005B63" epub:type="glossterm"><dfn>self-monitoring</dfn></dt>

Where do they come from? Many of our most basic attitudes derive from early, direct personal experience. Children are rewarded with smiles and encouragement when they please their parents, and they are punished through disapproval when they displease them. These early experiences give children enduring attitudes (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007305"><?REGION x="246.890" y="585.180" w="161.619" h="9.500" page="493" pagename="493"?>Castelli, Zogmaister, &amp; Tomelleri, 2009</a>). Attitudes are also formed by imitation. Children mimic the behavior of their parents and peers, acquiring attitudes even when no one is deliberately trying to shape them.</p>

Teachers, friends, and even famous people are also important in shaping our attitudes.

For example, a prejudiced storeowner may smile at an African American customer to disguise opinions that could hurt his business. Likewise, many institutional practices can be discriminatory even though they are not based on prejudice. For example, regulations establishing a minimum height requirement for police officers may discriminate against women and certain ethnic groups whose average height falls below the standard, even though the regulations do not stem from sexist or racist attitudes.</p></aside>

Prejudicial beliefs are virtually always negative stereotypes; and, as mentioned earlier, reliance on stereotypes can lead to erroneous thinking about other people. The <i>ultimate attribution error</i> refers to the tendency for a person with stereotyped beliefs about a particular group of people to make internal attributions for their shortcomings (they lack ability or motivation) and external attributions for their successes (they were given special advantages) (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000776C"><?REGION x="471.316" y="412.180" w="86.684" h="9.500" page="494" pagename="494"?>P.

As we saw earlier, people are “cognitive misers” who try to simplify and organize their social thinking as much as possible. Oversimplification can lead to erroneous thinking, stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. For example, belief in a just world—where people get what they deserve and deserve what they get—oversimplifies one’s view of the victims of prejudice as somehow “deserving” their plight. This may be why some people watching Sher Singh’s arrest jumped to the conclusion that he was a terrorist who “deserved” to be arrested.</p>

If we associate with people who express prejudices, we are more likely to go along with their ideas than to resist them. The pressures of social conformity help to explain why children quickly absorb the prejudices of their parents and playmates long before they have formed their own beliefs and opinions on the basis of experience. Peer pressure sometimes makes it “cool” or at least acceptable to harbor biased attitudes toward members of other social groups: Either you are one of “us,” or you are one of “them.” An in-group is any group of people who feels a sense of solidarity and exclusivity in relation to nonmembers. An out-group, in contrast, is a group of people who are outside this boundary and are viewed as competitors, enemies, or different and unworthy of respect. These terms can be applied to opposing sports teams, rival gangs, and political parties, or to entire nations, regions, religions, and ethnic or racial groups. According to the in-group bias, members see themselves not just as different, but also as superior to members of out-groups (K. Miller, Brewer, &amp; Arbuckle, 2009). In extreme cases, members of an in-group may see members of an out-group as less than human and feel hatred that may lead to violence, civil war, and even genocide.</p>

Racists believe that intelligence, industry, morality, and other valued traits are biologically determined and therefore cannot be changed. The most blatant forms of racism in the United States have declined during the past several decades as evidenced by the election of the first African American President, Barack Obama in 2008. But racism still exists in subtle forms. For example, many Whites say that they approve of interracial marriage, but would be “uncomfortable” if someone in their family married an African American. Blacks and Whites in America also have different views on race-related policies such as school desegregation and affirmative action, with Blacks generally being more supportive of such policies (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000077D6"><?REGION x="93.611" y="615.180" w="82.101" h="9.500" page="495" pagename="495"?>Julie Hughes, 2009</a>).

These more inclusive schemata become superordinate categories. For instance, both Catholics and Protestants in the United States tend to view themselves as Christians, rather than as separate competing groups (as has occurred in Northern Ireland). If people can create such superordinate categories, they can often reduce stereotypes and prejudice (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000075E7"><?REGION x="380.072" y="240.180" w="124.990" h="9.500" page="496" pagename="496"?>S.

But changing behavior is often a first step toward changing attitudes. This is not to say that attitude change follows automatically. Attitudes can be difficult to budge because they are often so deeply rooted. Completely eliminating deeply held attitudes, then, can be very difficult. That is why social psychologists have concentrated so much effort on techniques that encourage attitude change.

In addition, multidisciplinary techniques must be developed if programs are to be fully effective in addressing conflicts in different cultures.

For example, we are more likely to change our attitude about the oil industry’s antipollution efforts if we hear the information from an impartial commission appointed to study the situation than if the president of a major refining company tells us about them. However, over a period of time, the credibility of the source becomes less important. Apparently we are inclined to forget the source, while remembering the content.

The <i>discrepancy</i> between the content of the message and the present attitudes of the audience also affects how well the message will be received. Up to a point, the greater the difference between the two, the greater the likelihood of attitude change, as long as the person delivering the message is considered an expert on the topic. If the discrepancy is too great, however, the <i>audience</i> may reject the new information altogether, even though it comes from an expert.</p>

Cognitive dissonance exists whenever a person has two contradictory cognitions, or beliefs, at the same time. “I am a considerate and loyal friend” is one cognition; “Yesterday I repeated some juicy gossip I heard about my friend Chris” is another cognition. These two cognitions are dissonant—each one implies the opposite of the other. According to Festinger, cognitive dissonance creates unpleasant psychological tension, which motivates us to try to resolve the dissonance in some way.</p><aside class="marginalia" id="P7000493190000000000000000005C07" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005C07"><section class="glossary" id="P7000493190000000000000000005C08" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005C08" epub:type="glossary"><dl class="glossentrylist" id="P7000493190000000000000000017407" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000017407"><dt class="glossterm" id="P7000493190000000000000000005C0A" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005C0A" epub:type="glossterm"><dfn>cognitive dissonance</dfn></dt>

I cannot easily change the fact that I have repeated gossip about a friend; therefore, it is easier to change my attitude toward my friend. If I conclude that Chris is not really a friend but simply an acquaintance, then my new attitude now fits my behavior—spreading gossip about someone who is <i>not</i> a friend does not contradict the fact that I am loyal and considerate to those who <i>are</i> my friends.</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001740B" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001740B">Discrepant behavior that contradicts an attitude does not necessarily bring about attitude change, however, because there are other ways a person can reduce cognitive dissonance. One alternative is to <i>increase the number of consonant elements</i>—that is, the thoughts that are consistent with one another. For example, I might recall the many times I defended Chris when others were critical of him. Now my repeating a little bit of gossip seems less at odds with my attitude toward Chris as a friend. Another option is to reduce the importance of one or both dissonant cognitions. For instance, I could tell myself, “The person I repeated the gossip to was Terry, who doesn’t really know Chris very well. Terry doesn’t care and won’t repeat it. It was no big deal, and Chris shouldn’t be upset about it.” By reducing the significance of my disloyal action, I reduce the dissonance that I experience and so make it less necessary to change my attitude toward Chris.</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001740C" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001740C">But why would someone engage in behavior that goes against an attitude in the first place? One answer is that cognitive dissonance is a natural part of everyday life. Simply choosing between two or more desirable alternatives leads inevitably to dissonance. Suppose you are in the market for a computer, but can’t decide between a PC and a Macintosh. If you choose one, all of its bad features and all the good aspects of the other contribute to dissonance. After you have bought one of the computers, you can reduce the dissonance by changing your attitude: You might decide that the other keyboard wasn’t “quite right” and that some of the “bad” features of the computer you bought aren’t so bad after all.</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001740D" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001740D">You may also engage in behavior at odds with an attitude because you are enticed to do so. Perhaps someone offers you a small bribe or reward: “I will pay you 25 cents just to try my product.” Curiously, the larger the reward, the smaller the change in attitude that is likely to result (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000724E"><?REGION x="150.268" y="742.180" w="74.208" h="9.500" page="499" pagename="499"?>J. W. Brehm, 2007</a>). When rewards are large, dissonance is at a <span class="pagebreak" title="500" id="P7000493190000000000000000005C11" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005C11" epub:type="pagebreak"/>minimum, and attitude change is small, if it happens at all. Apparently, when people are convinced that there is a good reason to do something that goes against their beliefs (“I’ll try almost anything in exchange for a large cash incentive”), they experience little dissonance, and their attitudes are not likely to shift, even though their behavior may change for a time. If the reward is small, however—just barely enough to induce behavior that conflicts with one’s attitude—dissonance will be great, maximizing the chances of attitude change: “I only got 25 cents to try this product, so it couldn’t have been the money that attracted me. I must really like this product after all.” The trick is to induce the behavior that goes against an attitude, while leaving people feeling personally responsible for the dissonant act. In that way, they are more likely to change their attitudes than if they feel they were blatantly induced to act in a way that contradicted their beliefs.</p>
