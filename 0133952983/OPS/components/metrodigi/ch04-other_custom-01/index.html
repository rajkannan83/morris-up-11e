                            <p>In studying Sensation and Perception, scientists determine thresholds for detection of stimuli for each of the senses.  These studies determine what are known as absolute thresholds and difference thresholds.  The  absolute threshold is the smallest amount of a stimulus that can be detected by the subject.  Thresholds are determined using a variety of procedures, though many involve the random presentation of stimuli of varying levels and tracking each presentation for whether or not the subject indicates they detect the stimulus.  The absolute threshold can be determined for a taste, a smell, a light, a sound, or pressure on the skin.</p>

                            <p>When investigating difference thresholds on perception of weight, Weber recognized that when subjects were given a heavier weight, that it required a greater overall change in the weight for them to notice a difference than when they were given a very light weight (Weber, 1834).  He named this consistent finding "Weber's Law" and introduced a mathematical equation that demonstrated the effect.  The mathematical equation is represented as displayed on the right.</p>

                            <p>The following experiment contains 80 pairs of circles with brightness levels that may or may not be identical. When presented with a pair of circles, indicate whether or not they are the same by selecting the "Same" or "Different" button. You will be shown the next set of circles once a button is clicked, so be sure of your answer before entering a response.</p>

                            <p>What most people see is that differences between the two disks are fairly easy to detect when the disks are dark, but that same difference is much harder to detect when the disks are light. This demonstrates Weber's Law which states that the ability to detect a difference between two stimuli depends on the intensity of the stimuli. Specifically, the more intense the stimulus (Light Base comparisons in this study), the harder it is to detect differences. If your performance on the Dark Base comparisons is better than your performance on the Light Base comparisons, then your data is supporting Weber's Law.</p>

                            <p>There are examples of Weber's Law all around you.  For example, at night, you can see stars, because the change in brightness they produce is large relative to the dark night sky.  During the day, those same stars are shining just as brightly at night, but you can't see them because now the change in brightness is miniscule when compared to the sun.  The little bit of noise that a ticking clock adds to a party isn't even noticed, but add that same ticking clock to a quiet room when you are trying to sleep and it becomes a nuisance you can't ignore.  Weber's law helps us to understand why we sometimes detect a stimulus and sometimes donâ€™t.</p>
