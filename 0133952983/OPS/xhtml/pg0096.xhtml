He proposed that children at different levels of moral reasoning base their moral choices on different factors: first, a concern about physical consequences; next, a concern about what other people think; and finally, a concern about abstract principles. One problem with this view is that it doesn’t consider how cultural values (associated with being female, African American, Japanese, and so on) may affect moral development.</p></section>

Contrary to earlier beliefs, the ability to speak more than one language is beneficial for children. The fact that young children learn a second language more quickly and speak it more fluently than adults demonstrates the importance of the environment in which they were raised.</p></section>

During the toddler period, a growing awareness of being a separate person makes developing some <b>autonomy</b> from parents a very important issue. Parents can encourage independence in their children by allowing them to make choices and do things on their own within a framework of reasonable and consistently enforced limits. Another major task during this period is forming a secure <b>attachment,</b> or emotional bond, with other people. Young animals of many species form a strong bond to the first moving object they see, a process known as <b>imprinting.</b> In contrast, human newborns only gradually form emotional bonds with their caregivers. Some of the other important tasks during infancy and early childhood include overcoming <b>stranger anxiety,</b> trusting other people (infancy), learning to take initiative in tackling new tasks (the preschool years), and mastering some of the many skills that will be needed in adulthood (middle and later childhood). Parenting style affects children’s behavior and self-image. The most successful parenting style is authoritative, in which parents provide firm guidance but are willing to listen to the child’s opinions. However, parents do not act the same way toward every child in the family because children are different from each other and elicit different parental responses. The <b>non-shared environment</b> refers to the unique aspects of the environment that are experienced differently by siblings even though they are reared in the same family.</p><p id="P70004931900000000000000000162AD" data-uri="M09_MORR8923_11_SE_C09.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000162AD">

Balancing the demands of job and family is often difficult, however, especially for women, because they tend to have most of the responsibility for housework and child care. Yet despite this stress of a “double shift,” a job outside the home is a positive, self-esteem-boosting factor in most women’s lives.</p></section>

Whereas adolescents search for the one “correct” solution to a problem, adults realize that there may be several “right” solutions—or none at all. Adults also place less faith in authority than adolescents do.</p></section>

As people grow older, they tend to become less self-centered and more comfortable in interpersonal relationships. They also develop better coping skills and new ways of adapting. By middle age, many adults feel an increasing commitment to, and responsibility for, others. This suggests that many adults are successfully meeting what Erik Erikson saw as the major challenge of middle adulthood: <i>generativity</i> (the ability to continue being productive and creative, especially in ways that guide and encourage future generations) <i>versus stagnation</i> (a sense of boredom or lack of fulfillment, sometimes called a <b>midlife crisis</b>). Most adults, however, do not experience dramatic upheaval in their middle years, so this period may be better thought of as one of <b>midlife transition.</b> Middle adulthood brings a decline in the functioning of the reproductive organs. In women, this is marked by <b>menopause</b>, the cessation of menstruation, accompanied by a sharp drop in estrogen levels, which may be associated with “hot flashes” and thinning bones. Men experience a slower decline in testosterone levels.</p></section></section>

We don’t yet know why these changes happen. Whatever the reason, physical aging is inevitable, although it can be slowed by a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, despite the physical changes, psychological well-being increases dramatically from the early 50s to at least age 85.</p></section>

Although their sexual responses may be slowed, most continue to enjoy sex beyond the 70s. Still, gradual social changes occur in late adulthood. Older adults start to interact with fewer people and perform fewer social roles. They may also become less influenced by social rules and expectations. Realizing that there is a limit to the capacity for social involvement, they learn to live with some restrictions.</p></section>

They do fear the pain, indignity, depersonalization, and loneliness associated with a terminal illness. They also worry about becoming a financial burden to their families. The death of a spouse may be the most severe challenge that the elderly face. Kübler-Ross described a sequence of five stages that people go through when they are dying: <i>denial, anger, bargaining, depression,</i> and <i>acceptance</i>.</p></section></section></section></body></html>
