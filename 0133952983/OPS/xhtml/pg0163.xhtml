First, an organizational analysis is done in which the company’s goals are examined and problems are identified. Next, for problems that lend themselves to training-based solutions, a task analysis is performed. Task analysis identifies which job tasks can be addressed through training. It also determines the knowledge (K), skills (S), abilities (A), and other characteristics (O) required to perform those tasks successfully. Finally, a person analysis is conducted to examine the knowledge, skills, and current performance of workers to determine which ones need additional training.</p>

Employees learn the new skills required for the job on the very equipment they are to use when performing their work. On-the-job training also conserves the organization’s resources, since it usually minimizes costs for training equipment and supplies. However, it also has some disadvantages. For example, productivity usually declines during the training period because learning each new task slows performance. Moreover, coworkers functioning as trainers usually cannot instruct trainees and perform their own jobs at the same time, leading to further declines in productivity. Finally, experienced employees do not always make skilled trainers: A highly competent worker may not necessarily have the skills to effectively train a new employee (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007DDA"><?REGION x="461.344" y="219.180" w="51.376" h="9.500" page="534" pagename="534"?>Riggio, 2003</a>).</p>

Many jobs associated with apprentice training programs are in heavily unionized occupations; plumbers, carpenters, electricians, and equipment operators in manufacturing industries often learn their skills through apprenticeship training. Today, more than 30,000 apprentice programs exist in the United States involving nearly a half-million trainees, called <i>apprentices</i> (U.S. Department of Labor, 2006). Apprentices go through a formal on-the-job training program, which includes both instruction and supervision by a skilled worker.</p>

For example, of all new additions to the workforce in the 1990s, nearly half (45%) were non-White and nearly two-thirds were women. In response to increasing workplace diversity, a growing trend exists among organizations to offer programs in cultural diversity training. One goal of such training is to create an atmosphere that is fair and nondiscriminatory for all employees; failing to do so puts companies at risk for lawsuits filed under antidiscrimination laws such as the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991. Cultural diversity training also alerts workers to how their actions may be offensive to others and helps them learn to work cooperatively with coworkers who represent different cultures or gender. Another goal of diversity training is to better capture “the benefits in creativity and problem-solving capabilities that a diverse workforce provides” (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007357"><?REGION x="237.094" y="171.180" w="143.778" h="9.500" page="535" pagename="535"?>Chrobot-Mason &amp; Quinones, 2002</a>).

Sexual harassment also exists when managers or coworkers create a <i>hostile work environment,</i> perhaps by telling sexist jokes, posting nude “pin-up” photos in lockers, or teasing of a sexual nature.

Based on their assessment of the value of the rewards they seek and of the degree to which they expect they can attain those rewards by working harder, they will expend the corresponding amount of effort on the job (Van Eerde &amp; Thierry, 1996; <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000080F8"><?REGION x="527.296" y="87.180" w="30.704" h="9.500" page="536" pagename="536"?>Vroom, <?REGION x="198.000" y="99.180" w="14.250" h="9.500" page="536" pagename="536"?>1964</a>). For example, if workers attach high value to a promotion and if they believe that through hard work they will be promoted, this expectancy will motivate them to perform. Conversely, if the rewards offered on the job are not perceived by workers to be valuable, or if workers do not believe that their efforts will result in the attainment of valued rewards, motivation and effort will diminish.</p><aside class="marginalia" id="P700049319000000000000000000624B" data-uri="Z02_MORR8923_11_SE_APPB.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000624B"><section class="glossary" id="P700049319000000000000000000624C" data-uri="Z02_MORR8923_11_SE_APPB.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000624C" epub:type="glossary"><dl class="glossentrylist" id="P7000493190000000000000000017805" data-uri="Z02_MORR8923_11_SE_APPB.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000017805"><dt class="glossterm" id="P700049319000000000000000000624E" data-uri="Z02_MORR8923_11_SE_APPB.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000624E" epub:type="glossterm"><dfn>expectancy theory</dfn></dt><dd class="glossdef" id="P7000493190000000000000000017806" data-uri="Z02_MORR8923_11_SE_APPB.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000017806" epub:type="glossdef">

Many people apply goal-setting theory in their own lives. For example, a student may work extra hours at a second part-time job to buy a car or pay the rent.

An example of reinforcement theory in a production setting is the <i>piece-rate system.</i> In a piece-rate system, workers are paid according to the number of “pieces” they assemble. Thus, a worker who builds 25 pieces in a day will be paid more than one who builds only 20 pieces. Sales commission systems, where sales agents are paid a percentage of the price of the products they sell, are another compensation system based on reinforcement theory.</p>

One study that examined the effect of reinforcement-based performance systems over a span of 20 years showed a 17% improvement in productivity (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007F98"><?REGION x="470.914" y="453.180" w="87.086" h="9.500" page="536" pagename="536"?>Stajkovic &amp; Luthans, <?REGION x="198.000" y="465.180" w="13.965" h="9.500" page="536" pagename="536"?>1997</a>). In a more recent study, more than 90% of organizations experienced sustainable improvements in worker productivity through reinforcement (Komaki, 2003). Moreover, when workers are paid according to their performance, their sense of autonomy and control over their work is also enhanced (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000074EE"><?REGION x="368.037" y="501.180" w="163.360" h="9.500" page="536" pagename="536"?>Eisenberger, Rhoades, &amp; Cameron, 1999</a>).</p>

For example, when workers are paid according to their own individual successes, they may be reluctant to participate in activities that require cooperation with others. In fact, “pay-for-performance” systems can encourage competitive behavior which, at the extreme, may involve sabotage of coworkers’ efforts and an overall decline in workplace productivity. Placing workers in highly stressful, competitive work environments poses yet another issue to consider when evaluating the desirability of reinforcement-based motivational approaches.</p></section></section>

Workers on a team may be trained to perform all jobs in their unit (a technique discussed earlier under <i>job rotation</i>) and then regularly exchange jobs. Job rotation helps to keeps skills sharp and also helps to relieve the boredom of performing the same job day after day.</p>

Three factors appear to underlie this trend. First, businesses exist within a complex, information-rich culture in which no employee can know or master everything needed to run a successful enterprise. Second, the modern workforce is better educated and thus better prepared to perform complex decision-making functions. Furthermore, workers at every organizational level expect to find challenge in their work; and most are unwilling to work at repetitive, intellectually empty tasks. Finally, the work performed in modern organizations has itself changed. Most jobs no longer consist of performing the same set of simple repetitive tasks; rather, they involve flexible approaches to rapidly changing technologies and business climates (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007BDA"><?REGION x="335.043" y="391.180" w="68.618" h="9.500" page="537" pagename="537"?>Muchinsky, 2006</a>).</p>

On the contrary, to be effective, the leader’s characteristics must match the demands of the situation. Consequently, a person who is very effective as a leader in one setting may not be effective in another. This situation is often observed in sales-based organizations that promote managers from within. There is no certainty that someone who is an outstanding leader in one division of a company will be effective if transferred to a different division. Similarly, a person who forms a small start-up company and leads it effectively during its formative years may not be the best person to lead the company when it has hundreds or thousands of employees and multiple offices worldwide.</p>
