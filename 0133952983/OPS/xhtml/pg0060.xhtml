It’s not surprising, then, that many researchers believe that the physical environments, values, self-views, and customs of a given culture have a profound effect on what and how easily people remember (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007E18"><?REGION x="290.479" y="428.863" w="80.198" h="9.500" page="213" pagename="213"?>Ross &amp; Wang, 2010</a>). In many Western cultures, for example, being able to recite a long list of words or numbers, to repeat the details of a scene, and to provide facts and figures about historical events are all signs of a “good memory.” In fact, tasks such as these are often used to test people’s memory abilities. However, these kinds of memory tasks do not necessarily reflect the type of learning, memorization, and categorization skills taught in non-Western schools. Members of other cultures often perform poorly on such memory tests because the exercises seem so odd to them.</p>

The cowherd could recite, with virtually no error, the selling price, type of cattle bought, and circumstances of the sale for purchases dating back several years. These skills are not surprising when you know that in Swazi culture the care and keeping of cattle are very important in daily life, and many cultural practices focus on the economic and social importance of cattle. In contrast, Bartlett reported, Swazi children did no better than his young European participants in recalling a 25-word message. Stripped of its cultural significance, their memory performance was not exceptional.

One hypothesis holds that childhood amnesia is a result of the child’s brain not being fully developed at birth. Consistent with this line of reasoning, Patricia Bauer and her colleagues (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007174"><?REGION x="171.640" y="221.160" w="44.842" h="8.500" page="215" pagename="215"?>Bauer, 2008</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007176"><?REGION x="221.324" y="221.160" w="83.628" h="8.500" page="215" pagename="215"?>Bauer, &amp; Larkina, 2013</a>) found that memories formed early in life may not consolidate properly because the specific regions of the brain devoted to memory consolidation are not yet fully developed, and as such remain vulnerable to interference. Childhood amnesia may also be linked to language skills: Young children do not have the language skills necessary to strengthen and consolidate early experiences (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000077CE"><?REGION x="362.892" y="161.160" w="97.630" h="8.500" page="215" pagename="215"?>Hudson &amp; Sheffield, 1998</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007F3C"><?REGION x="466.769" y="161.160" w="92.845" h="8.500" page="215" pagename="215"?>Simcock &amp; Hayne, 2002</a>).

For over 20 years, Luria studied a Russian newspaper reporter named Shereshevskii (“S”). In <i>The Mind of a Mnemonist</i> (1968), Luria described how “S” could recall masses of senseless trivia as well as detailed mathematical formulas and complex arrays of numbers. He could easily repeat lists of up to 70 words or numbers after having heard or seen them only once.</p>

Rather, they have carefully developed memory techniques using certain principles. For example, Luria discovered that when “S” studied long lists of words, he would form a graphic image for every item. When reading a long and random list of words, for example, “S” might visualize a well-known street, specifically associating each word with some object along the way. When asked to recite the lists of words, he would take an imaginary walk down that street, recalling each object and the word associated with it. By organizing his data in a way that was meaningful to him, he could more easily link them to existing material in his long-term memory.</p>

First, flashbulb memories are certainly not always accurate. Although this is a difficult contention to test, let’s consider just one case. Psychologist Ulric Neisser vividly recalled what he was doing on the day in 1941 when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. He clearly remembered that he was listening to a professional baseball game on the radio, which was interrupted by the shocking announcement. But professional baseball is not played in December, when the attack took place, so this sharp flashbulb memory was simply incorrect (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007C35"><?REGION x="328.747" y="655.180" w="54.615" h="9.500" page="216" pagename="216"?>Neisser, 1982</a>).</p>

We are bound to discuss and rethink a major event many times, and we probably also hear a great deal of additional information about that event in the weeks and months after it occurs.

Some of the participants were asked, “About how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?” Other participants were asked the same question, but with the words <i>smashed into, collided with, bumped into,</i> or <i>contacted</i> in place of <i>hit.</i> The researchers discovered that people’s reports of the cars’ speeds depended on which word was inserted in the question. Those asked about cars that “smashed into” each other reported that the cars were going faster than those who were asked about cars that “contacted” each other. In another experiment, the participants were also shown a film of a collision and then were asked either “How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?” or “How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?” One week later, they were asked some additional questions about the accident that they had seen on film the week before. One of the questions was “Did you see any broken glass?” More of the participants who had been asked about cars that had “smashed into” each other reported that they had seen broken glass than did participants who had been asked the speed of cars that “hit” each other. These findings illustrate how police, lawyers, and other investigators may, often unconsciously, sway witnesses and influence subsequent eyewitness accounts. On the basis of experiments like these, Loftus and Palmer concluded that eyewitness testimony is unreliable.</p>

Over three-quarters of the experts agreed that an eyewitness may mistakenly identify someone they saw in another situation as a culprit, less than a third of the jurors agreed. And while more than nine out of ten of the experts agreed that hypnosis may influence a witness’s suggestibility toward leading and misleading questions, less than a quarter of the jurors believed that hypnosis could have such an impact. In sum, the authors concluded that jurors have limited knowledge concerning the veracity of eyewitness testimony and their beliefs concerning the accuracy of eyewitness testimony differ significantly from the opinions of experts.</p>

The idea is that people experience an event, then lose all memory of it, and then later recall it, often in the course of psychotherapy or under hypnosis. Frequently, the recovered memories concern physical or sexual abuse during childhood. The issue is important not only for theoretical reasons, but also because of the fact that people have been imprisoned for abuse solely on the basis of the recovered memories of their “victims” (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007620"><?REGION x="321.827" y="607.905" w="184.352" h="9.500" page="218" pagename="218"?>Geraerts, Raymaekers, &amp; Merckelbach, 2008</a>). Adding to this confusion is research that shows children’s memories are particularly influenced by negative emotions. Thus, when recalling events associated with an uncomfortable experience, such as abuse, children are more likely to make factual errors than when recalling neutral or positive events (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000724A"><?REGION x="344.311" y="655.905" w="208.246" h="9.500" page="218" pagename="218"?>Brainerd, Stein, Silveira, Rohenkold, &amp; Reyna, 2008</a>). No one denies the reality of childhood abuse or the damage that such experiences cause. But are the recovered memories real? Did the remembered abuse really occur?</p>

There is ample evidence that people can be induced to “remember” events that never happened (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007E60"><?REGION x="423.954" y="703.905" w="53.835" h="9.500" page="218" pagename="218"?>Saletan, 2010</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007F6C"><?REGION x="483.241" y="703.905" w="74.759" h="9.500" page="218" pagename="218"?>S.

Research confirms that it is relatively easy to implant memories of an experience merely by asking about it. Sometimes these memories become quite real to the participant. In one experiment, 25% of adults “remembered” fictitious events by the third time <span class="pagebreak" title="219" id="P7000493190000000000000000002B3E" data-uri="M06_MORR8923_11_SE_C06.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000002B3E" epub:type="pagebreak"/>they were interviewed about them. One of the fictitious events involved knocking over a punch bowl onto the parents of the bride at a wedding reception. At the first interview, one participant said that she had no recollection whatsoever of the event; by the second interview, she “remembered” that the reception was outdoors and that she had knocked over the bowl while running around. Some people even “remembered” details about the event, such as what people looked like and what they wore. Yet, the researchers documented that these events never happened (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000077F2"><?REGION x="251.226" y="123.180" w="142.527" h="9.500" page="219" pagename="219"?>Hyman, Husband, &amp; Billings, 1995</a>).</p>

And some people who have “recovered” abuse memories have later realized that the events never occurred. Some of these people have brought suit against the therapists who, they came to believe, implanted the memories. In one case, a woman won such a suit and was awarded $850,000 (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000077F8"><?REGION x="134.702" y="195.180" w="46.407" h="9.500" page="219" pagename="219"?>Imrie, 1999</a>; also see <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007620"><?REGION x="220.467" y="195.180" w="184.108" h="9.500" page="219" pagename="219"?>Geraerts, Raymaekers, &amp; Merckelbach, 2008</a>).</p>

There are numerous case studies of people who have lived through traumatic experiences, including natural disasters, accidents, combat, assault, and rape, who then apparently forgot these events for many years, but who later remembered them. For example, Wilbur J. Scott, a sociologist, claimed to remember nothing of his tour of duty in Vietnam during 1968–1969, but during a divorce in 1983, he discovered his medals and souvenirs from Vietnam, and the memories then came back to him (<?REGION x="108.757" y="291.180" w="94.695" h="9.500" page="219" pagename="219"?>Arrigo &amp; Pezdek, 1997).</p>

The sincerity and conviction of the person who “remembers” long-forgotten childhood abuse is no indication of the reality of that abuse. However, evidence does suggest that people who recover memories during suggestive therapy are at an increased risk of fabricating false memories compared to individuals who spontaneously recover memories of abuse (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000761E"><?REGION x="367.880" y="363.180" w="46.120" h="9.500" page="219" pagename="219"?>Geraerts et <?REGION x="54.000" y="375.180" w="28.024" h="9.500" page="219" pagename="219"?>al., 2009</a>). Nevertheless, we are left with the conclusion that recovered memories are not, in themselves, sufficiently trustworthy to justify criminal convictions. There must also be corroborative evidence, since without corroboration, there is no way that even the most experienced examiner can separate real memories from false ones (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007A58"><?REGION x="356.778" y="411.180" w="57.222" h="9.500" page="219" pagename="219"?>Loftus, Garry, <?REGION x="54.000" y="423.180" w="55.641" h="9.881" page="219" pagename="219"?>&amp; Hayne, 2008</a>).<a id="P7000493190000000000000000002B42" data-href="ch06sb04v" data-uri="M06_MORR8923_11_SE_C06.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000002B42"/></p>
