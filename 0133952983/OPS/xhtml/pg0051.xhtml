From studies of how animals or humans find their way around a maze, a building, or a neighborhood with many available routes, psychologists have proposed that this kind of learning is stored in the form of a mental image, or <b>cognitive map</b>. When the proper time comes, the learner can call up the stored image and put it to use.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000014F4F" data-uri="M05_MORR8923_11_SE_C05.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000014F4F">In response to Tolman’s theory of latent learning, Thorndike proposed an experiment to test whether a rat could learn to run a maze and store a cognitive image of the maze without experiencing the maze firsthand. He envisioned researchers carrying each rat through the maze in a small wire-mesh container and then rewarding the rat at the end of each trial as if it had run the maze itself. He predicted that the rat would show little or no evidence of learning as compared with rats that had learned the same maze on their own through trial and error. Neither he nor Tolman ever conducted the experiment.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000014F50" data-uri="M05_MORR8923_11_SE_C05.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000014F50">Two decades later, however, researchers at the University of Kansas did carry out Thorndike’s idea (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007B4C"><?REGION x="275.519" y="588.029" w="135.574" h="9.500" page="180" pagename="180"?>McNamara, Long, &amp; Wike, 1956</a>). But instead of taking the passive rats through the “correct” path, they carried them over the same path that a free-running rat had taken in that maze. Contrary to Thorndike’s prediction, the passenger rats learned the maze just as well as the free-running rats. They did, however, need visual cues to learn the maze’s layout.

Outside a chimpanzee’s cage, Kör placed a banana on the ground, not quite within the animal’s reach. When the chimp realized that it couldn’t reach the banana, it reacted with frustration. But then it started looking at what was in the cage, including a stick left there by Kör. Sometimes quite suddenly the chimp would grab the stick, poke it through the bars of the cage, and drag the banana within reach. The same kind of sudden insight occurred when the banana was hung from the roof of the cage, too high for the chimp to grasp. This time the cage contained some boxes, which the chimp quickly learned to stack up under the banana so that it could climb up to pull the fruit down. Subsequent studies have shown that even pigeons under certain conditions can display insight (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000070F6"><?REGION x="185.667" y="288.225" w="82.792" h="18.000" page="181" pagename="181"?>Aust &amp; Huber, 2006</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007FB4"><?REGION x="273.228" y="288.225" w="105.687" h="18.000" page="181" pagename="181"?>Stephan &amp; Bugnyar, 2013</a>).<a id="P70004931900000000000000000024F7" data-href="#P70004931900000000000000000024FE" data-uri="M05_MORR8923_11_SE_C05.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000024F7"/> </p><aside class="marginalia" id="P70004931900000000000000000024F8" data-uri="M05_MORR8923_11_SE_C05.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000024F8"><section class="glossary" id="P70004931900000000000000000024F9" data-uri="M05_MORR8923_11_SE_C05.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000024F9" epub:type="glossary"><dl class="glossentrylist" id="P7000493190000000000000000014F57" data-uri="M05_MORR8923_11_SE_C05.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000014F57"><dt class="glossterm" id="P70004931900000000000000000024FB" data-uri="M05_MORR8923_11_SE_C05.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000024FB" epub:type="glossterm"><dfn>insight</dfn></dt>

This was demonstrated by Harry Harlow in a series of studies with rhesus monkeys (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007715"><?REGION x="57.078" y="330.180" w="55.370" h="9.500" page="181" pagename="181"?>Harlow, 1949</a>). Harlow presented each monkey with two boxes—say, a round green box on the left side of a tray and a square red box on the right side. A morsel of food was put under one of the boxes. The monkey was permitted to lift just one box; if it chose the correct box, it got the food. On the next trial, the food was put under the same box (which had been moved to a new position), and the monkey again got to choose just one box. Each monkey had six trials to figure out that the same box covered the food no matter where that box was located. Then the monkeys were given a new set of choices—say, between a blue triangular box and an orange oval one—and another six trials, and so on with other shapes and colors of boxes. The solution was always the same: The food was invariably under only one of the boxes. Initially the monkeys chose boxes randomly, sometimes finding the food, sometimes not. After a while, however, their behavior changed: In just one or two trials, they would find the correct box, which they chose consistently thereafter until the experimenter changed the boxes. They seemed to have learned the underlying principle—that the food would always be under the same box—and they used that learning to solve almost instantly each new set of choices given.</p>

First, we can’t pay attention to everything going on around us. The behaviors we are most likely to imitate are those that are modeled by someone who commands our attention (as does a famous or attractive person, or an expert). Second, we must remember what a model does in order to imitate it. If a behavior isn’t memorable, it won’t be learned. Third, we must make an effort to convert what we see into action. If we have no motivation to perform an observed behavior, we probably won’t show what we’ve learned. This is a distinction between <i>learning</i> and <i>performance,</i> which is crucial to social learning theorists: We can learn without any change in overt behavior that demonstrates our learning. Whether or not we act depends on our motivation.</p>

Three groups of nursery schoolchildren watched a film in which an adult model walked up to an adult-size plastic inflated doll and ordered it to move out of the way. When the doll failed to obey, the model became aggressive, pushing the doll on its side, punching it in the nose, hitting it with a rubber mallet, kicking it around the room, and throwing rubber balls at it. However, each group of children saw a film with a different ending. Those in the <i>model-rewarded condition</i> saw the model showered with candies, soft drinks, and praise by a second adult (vicarious reinforcement). Those in the <i>model-punished condition</i> saw the second adult shaking a finger at the model, scolding, and spanking him (vicarious punishment). And those in the <i>no-consequences condition</i> saw nothing happen to the model as a result of his aggressive behavior.</p>

Each child played alone for 10 minutes, while observers behind a one-way mirror recorded the number of imitated aggressive behaviors that the child spontaneously performed in the absence of any direct reinforcement for those actions. After 10 minutes, an experimenter entered the room and offered the child treats in return for imitating things the model had done. This was a measure of how much the child had previously learned from watching the model, but perhaps hadn’t yet displayed.</p>

Suppose that you want to get a child to stop hitting other children. You might think that slapping the child as punishment would change the behavior, and it probably would suppress it to some extent. But slapping the child also demonstrates that hitting is an effective means of getting one’s way. So slapping not only provides a model of aggression; it also provides a model associated with vicarious reinforcement. Perhaps this is why children who experience corporal punishment are more likely to imitate the violent behavior of their parents when they become adults (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007160"><?REGION x="229.254" y="207.180" w="45.495" h="9.500" page="184" pagename="184"?>Barry, 2007</a>). You and the child would both be better off if the punishment given for hitting was not a similar form of aggression and if the child could also be rewarded for showing appropriate interactions with others (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007626"><?REGION x="406.616" y="231.180" w="106.912" h="9.500" page="184" pagename="184"?>Gershoff &amp; Bitensky, 2007</a>).</p>

According to social learning theory, humans use their powers of observation and thought to interpret their own experiences and those of others when deciding how to act. Moreover, human beings are capable of setting performance standards for themselves and then rewarding (or punishing) themselves for achieving or failing to achieve those standards as a way to regulate their own behavior.

Moreover, animals are capable of latent learning, learning cognitive maps, and insight, all of which involve cognitive processes. Do nonhuman animals also exhibit other evidence of cognitive learning? The answer seems to be a qualified yes.</p>
