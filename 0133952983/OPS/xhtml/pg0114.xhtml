Psychologists disagree, however, about what constitutes <i>good</i> adjustment. Some think it is the ability to live according to social norms. Thus, a woman who grows up in a small town, attends college, teaches for a year or two, and then settles down to a peaceful family life might be considered well adjusted because she is living by the predominant values of her community.</p>

They argue that society is not always right. Thus, if we accept its standards blindly, we renounce the right to make individual judgments. For instance, V. E. <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007C73"><?REGION x="274.667" y="224.803" w="111.610" h="9.500" page="409" pagename="409"?>O’Leary and Bhaju (2006)</a> argue that well-adjusted people enjoy the difficulties and ambiguities of life, treating them as challenges to be overcome. Such people are aware of their strengths and weaknesses; this awareness empowers them to live in harmony with their inner selves. For example, although aging involves declining health and decreased mobility, successful aging also involves the opportunity for psychological growth and maturation. The idea that adversity may serve as an impetus for psychological growth is also consistent with the positive psychology movement.</p>

They also tend to form deep, close relationships with a few chosen individuals.</p>

Happiness does contribute to a sense of well-being, but there are limits: experiencing too much happiness, experiencing happiness at the wrong time or in the wrong place, and pursuing happiness in inappropriate ways are not the hallmarks of a well-adjusted person.
