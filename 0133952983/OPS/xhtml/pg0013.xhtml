People regarded their mental processes with awe, assuming that thoughts and emotions were the work of spirits and gods. That all changed when Greek philosophers began to speculate about how the mind works, about where thoughts and feelings come from if not from the gods, and about how the mind might affect behavior. Socrates (470–399 B.C.E.) believed that we are born with knowledge and, by reasoning correctly, we gain access to it. He also believed that our minds (souls) do not cease to exist when we die. In other words, thoughts and ideas are distinct from the world of real objects and our bodies, a concept that is known as <a class="keyword" id="P70004931900000000000000000007A4" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000007A4" epub:type="keyword" href="pg0166.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000006A76"><?REGION x="252.546" y="487.123" w="35.748" h="9.500" page="10" pagename="10"?>dualism</a><a class="xref" id="P70004931900000000000000000007A5" data-href="#P70004931900000000000000000007A8" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000007A5"/>. Plato (427–347 B.C.E.) was a student of Socrates. Not surprisingly, he believed in innate knowledge that we access through careful reasoning. He also divided the world into two realms, with mind being pure and abstract, and all else physical and mundane. He also suggested that reason is responsible for balancing our desires (appetites) on the one hand with our (spirit) on the other in pursuit of reason’s goals. As we will see, this notion is remarkably similar to ideas put forth by Sigmund Freud thousands of years later. Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) was a student of Plato but he came to very different conclusions about the sources of knowledge. In particular, he believed that we acquire knowledge by observing the physical world and using logic and reasoning to make sense of our observations. We perceive the world, remember at least some of what we have perceived, and by thinking we arrive at understanding. In other words, there is no innate knowledge. His emphasis on careful observation and reasoning about facts are precursors to the modern, scientific study of behavior.</p>

Moreover, though the mind is not observable, it controls the body; and in turn, the body provides information for the mind. You will recognize this as another example of dualism. And indeed understanding the relation between mind and body continues to challenge psychologists today, as we will see. John Locke (1632–1704) took a very different view. Like Aristotle, he concluded that we gain knowledge through experience. In sharp contrast to Socrates <span class="pagebreak" title="11" id="P70004931900000000000000000007A7" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000007A7" epub:type="pagebreak"/>and Plato, he said the human mind at the moment of birth is a <i>tabula rasa,</i> a “blank slate” that contains no innate knowledge. And unlike Descartes, he believed that even the human mind operates according to laws. Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) went even further. He claimed that such things as “soul” and “spirit” and “mind” are meaningless. According to Hobbes, thoughts and experiences are simply by-products of the workings of our brain. In this respect, Hobbes anticipated the position of psychological behaviorists as we shall soon see. Charles Darwin (1809–1882) followed in Hobbes’s path by asserting that while the mind is unobservable (and thus not a proper subject for scientific study), behavior is observable and thus open to scientific examination. Moreover, Darwin took the position that behavior evolves—behavior that contributes to the survival of a species tends to persist, while behavior that is detrimental to survival tends to disappear over time. Evolutionary psychologists today follow in that same tradition.</p>

Only then did psychology come into being as a formal, scientific discipline separate from philosophy. The history of psychology can be divided into three main stages: the emergence of a science of the mind, the behaviorist decades, and the “cognitive revolution.”</p>

The primary method of collecting data was introspection or self-observation, which occurred in a laboratory or on an analyst’s couch.</p>

In the public eye, a laboratory identified a field of inquiry as “science” (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007199"><?REGION x="158.140" y="550.180" w="64.251" h="9.500" page="11" pagename="11"?>Benjamin, 2000</a>). At the outset, Wundt did not attract much attention; only four students attended his first lecture. By the mid-1890s, however, his classes were filled to capacity.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000013C52" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000013C52">Wundt attempted to explain immediate experience and to develop ways to study it scientifically, though he also believed that some mental processes could not be studied through scientific experiments. Wundt was primarily interested in memory and <i>selective attention—</i>the process by which we determine what we are going to attend to at any given moment. Wundt used the term <i>voluntarism</i> to describe his view of psychology. He believed that attention is actively controlled by intentions and motives, and that this sets human attention apart from attention in other organisms. In turn, attention controls such other psychological processes as perceptions, thoughts, and memories. We will examine the role of attention more closely in <a class="xref" href="pg0039.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000001BD5"><?REGION x="66.496" y="694.180" w="43.590" h="9.500" page="11" pagename="11"?><span class="label">Chapter </span><span class="number">4</span></a> (“States of Consciousness”) and <a class="xref" href="pg0054.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000026BA"><?REGION x="258.951" y="694.180" w="43.590" h="9.500" page="11" pagename="11"?><span class="label">Chapter </span><span class="number">6</span></a> (“Memory”), but for the moment it is sufficient to note that, in establishing a laboratory and insisting on measurement and experimentation, Wundt moved psychology out of the realm of philosophy and into the world of science.</p>

Stanley Hall (who established the first American psychology laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in 1883), J. M. Cattell (a professor at the University of Pennsylvania in 1888, who was the first American to be called a “professor of psychology”), and British-born Edward Bradford Titchener, who went to Cornell University. Titchener’s ideas differed sharply in many respects from those of his mentor (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000008001"><?REGION x="485.857" y="123.180" w="66.690" h="9.500" page="12" pagename="12"?>Sundqvist, 2007</a>). Titchener was impressed by recent advances in chemistry and physics, achieved by analyzing complex compounds (molecules) in terms of their basic elements (atoms). Similarly, Titchener reasoned, psychologists should analyze complex experiences in terms of their simplest components. For example, when people look at a banana they immediately think, “Here is a fruit, something to peel and eat.” But this perception is based on associations with past experience; what are the most fundamental elements, or “atoms,” of thought?</p>

Even the most complex thoughts and feelings, he argued, can be reduced to these simple elements. Titchener saw psychology’s role as identifying these elements and showing how they can be combined and integrated—an approach known as <a class="keyword" id="P70004931900000000000000000007C1" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000007C1" epub:type="keyword" href="pg0166.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000006F93"><?REGION x="244.145" y="279.180" w="57.132" h="9.500" page="12" pagename="12"?>structuralism</a>.

As a young man, James earned a degree in physiology and also studied philosophy on his own, unable to decide which interested him more. In psychology, he found the link between the two. In 1875, James offered a class in psychology at Harvard. He later commented that the first lecture he ever heard on the subject was his own. His writings touched on almost every issue of interest to contemporary psychologists (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000070F8"><?REGION x="201.306" y="429.180" w="53.998" h="9.500" page="12" pagename="12"?>Austin, 2013</a>).</p>

Our minds are constantly weaving associations, revising experience, starting, stopping, and jumping back and forth in time. Perceptions, emotions, and images cannot be separated, James argued; consciousness flows in a continuous stream. If we could not recognize a banana, we would have to figure out what it was each time we saw one. Mental associations allow us to benefit from previous experience. When we get up in the morning, get dressed, open the door, and walk down the street, we don’t have to think about what we are doing: We act out of habit. James suggested that when we repeat something, our nervous systems are changed so that each repetition is easier than the last.</p>

This theory raised questions about learning, the complexities of mental life, the impact of experience on the brain, and humankind’s place in the natural world that still seem current today. Although impatient with experiments, James shared Wundt and Titchener’s belief that the goal of psychology was to analyze experience.</p>

A medical doctor, unlike the other figures we have introduced, Freud was fascinated by the central nervous system. He spent many years conducting research in the physiology laboratory of the University of Vienna and only reluctantly became a practicing physician. After a trip to Paris, where he studied with a neurologist who was using hypnosis to treat nervous disorders, Freud established a private practice in Vienna in 1886. His work with patients convinced him that many nervous ailments are <span class="pagebreak" title="13" id="P70004931900000000000000000007D9" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000007D9" epub:type="pagebreak"/>psychological, rather than physiological, in origin. Freud’s clinical observations led him to develop a comprehensive theory of mental life that differed radically from the views of his predecessors.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000013C5F" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000013C5F">Freud held that human beings are not as rational as they imagine and that “free will,” which was so important to Wundt, is largely an illusion. Rather, we are motivated by unconscious instincts and urges that are not available to the rational, conscious part of our mind. Other psychologists had referred to the unconscious, in passing, as a dusty warehouse of old experiences and information we could retrieve as needed. In contrast, Freud saw the unconscious as a dynamic cauldron of primitive sexual and aggressive drives, forbidden desires, nameless fears and wishes, and traumatic childhood memories. Although hidden from awareness, unconscious impulses press on the conscious mind and find expression in disguised or altered form, including dreams, mannerisms, slips of the tongue, and symptoms of mental illness, as well as in socially acceptable pursuits such as art and literature. To uncover the unconscious, Freud developed the technique of <i>free association,</i> in which the patient lies on a couch, recounts dreams, and says whatever comes to mind.</p>

Many of Freud’s Victorian contemporaries were shocked, not only by his emphasis on sexuality, but also by his suggestion that we are often unaware of our true motives and thus are not entirely in control of our thoughts and behavior. Conversely, members of the medical community in Vienna at that time generally held Freud’s new theory in high regard, nominating him for the position of Professor Extraordinarious at the University of Vienna (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007530"><?REGION x="148.032" y="327.180" w="60.195" h="9.500" page="13" pagename="13"?>Esterson, 2002</a>). Freud’s lectures and writings attracted considerable attention in the United States as well as in Europe; he had a profound impact on the arts and philosophy, as well as on psychology. However, Freud’s theories and methods continue to inspire heated debate.</p>

He decided to find out whether salivation, an automatic reflex, could be shaped by learning. He began by repeatedly pairing the sound of a buzzer with the presence of food. The next step was to observe what happened when the buzzer was sounded without introducing food. This experiment clearly demonstrated what Pavlov had noticed incidentally: After repeated pairings, the dogs salivated in response to the buzzer alone. Pavlov called this simple form of training <i>conditioning.</i> Thus, a new school of psychology was inspired by a casual observation—followed by rigorous experiments.

In one of the most infamous experiments in psychology’s history, Watson attempted to create a conditioned fear response in an 11-month-old boy. “Little Albert” was a secure, happy baby who enjoyed new places and experiences. On his first visit to Watson’s laboratory, Albert was delighted by a tame, furry white rat, but he became visibly frightened when Watson banged a steel bar with a hammer just behind the infant’s head. On his second visit, Watson placed the rat near Albert, and the moment the baby reached out and touched the rat, Watson banged the hammer. After half a dozen pairings, little Albert began crying the instant the rat was introduced, without any banging. Further experiments found that Albert was frightened by anything white and furry—a rabbit, a dog, a sealskin coat, cotton wool, and Watson wearing a Santa Claus mask (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000008131"><?REGION x="255.636" y="387.180" w="122.968" h="9.500" page="14" pagename="14"?>J.

Freud had labeled the transfer of emotions from one person or object to another “displacement,” a neurotic response that he traced to the unconscious. Drawing on Pavlov, Watson called the same phenomenon “generalization,” a simple matter of conditioning. As far as Watson was concerned, psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis were “voodooism.”</p>

Mary Cover Jones, one of his graduate students, successfully reconditioned a boy who showed a fear of rabbits (not caused by laboratory conditioning) to overcome this fear. Her technique, which involved presenting the rabbit at a great distance and then gradually bringing it closer while the child was eating, is similar to conditioning techniques used by psychologists today.</p></section>

F. Skinner became one of the leaders of the behaviorist school of psychology in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. Like Watson, Skinner fervently believed that psychologists should study only observable and measurable behavior. He, too, was primarily interested in changing behavior through conditioning—and in discovering natural laws of behavior in the process. But Skinner added a new element to the behaviorist repertoire: reinforcement. He rewarded his subjects for behaving the way he wanted them to behave. For example, an animal was put into a special cage and allowed to explore it. Eventually, the animal reached up and pressed a lever or pecked at a disk on the wall, whereupon a food pellet dropped into the box. Gradually, the animal learned that pressing the bar or pecking at the disk always brought food. Why did the animal learn this? It learned because it was <i>reinforced,</i> or rewarded, for doing so. Skinner thus made the animal an active agent in its own conditioning.</p>

On one hand, research on perception, personality, child development, interpersonal relations, and other topics that behaviorists had ignored raised questions they couldn’t readily explain. On the other hand, research in other fields (especially anthropology, linguistics, neurobiology, and computer science) was shedding new light on the workings of the mind. Psychologists came to view behaviorism not as an all-encompassing theory, but as only one piece of the puzzle that played an important role in the development of psychology as a science (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007BBE"><?REGION x="171.954" y="279.680" w="51.785" h="9.500" page="15" pagename="15"?>Moore, 2010</a>).

The field evolved from a period in which consciousness was considered inaccessible to scientific inquiry to one in which researchers resumed investigating and theorizing about the mind—but now with new research methods and behaviorism’s commitment to objective, empirical research. As a result of this shift in focus, even the definition of psychology changed. Psychology is still the study of human behavior, but psychologists’ concept of “behavior” has been expanded to include thoughts, feelings, and states of consciousness (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007650"><?REGION x="404.260" y="215.180" w="140.180" h="9.500" page="16" pagename="16"?>Glenberg, Witt, &amp; Metcalfe, 2013</a>).</p>

In developmental psychology, for example, the idea that a child is a blank slate was replaced by a new view of babies and children as aware, competent, social beings. In this new view, children actively seek to learn about and make sense of their world. Moreover, all healthy children are “equipped” with such distinctively human characteristics as the ability to acquire language through exposure, without formal education. Developmental psychology is one of several subfields contributing to and benefiting from the emergence of cognitive psychology.</p>

Though the application of evolutionary theory to the understanding of human behavior was initially advanced by Charles Darwin himself more than a century ago (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000072A0"><?REGION x="295.806" y="335.180" w="70.061" h="9.500" page="17" pagename="17"?>Burghardt, 2009</a>), few psychologists adopted this perspective until recently. Today, the application of evolutionary theory to understanding human behavior has experienced a renaissance, particularly as psychologists pay increased attention to the biological foundations of behaviors, behavioral genetics and human diversity (<?REGION x="303.478" y="383.180" w="45.300" h="9.500" page="17" pagename="17"?>Buss, 2011). As stated by David Buss, one of the foremost evolutionary psychologists, “Evolutionary psychology synthesizes modern evolutionary biology and psychology to penetrate some of life’s deep mysteries: Why do many struggles center around sex? Why is social conflict pervasive? And what are the mechanisms of mind that define human nature?” (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000072B2"><?REGION x="57.277" y="443.180" w="44.479" h="9.500" page="17" pagename="17"?>Buss, 2009</a>, p. 140).</p></section>

But did psychology really have only fathers and no mothers? If there were women pioneers in the field, why are their names and accomplishments missing from historical accounts?</p>

In the United States, women presented papers and joined the national professional association as soon as it was formed in 1892. Often, however, they faced discrimination. Some colleges and universities did not grant degrees to women; professional journals were reluctant to publish their work; and teaching positions were often closed to them. Despite these barriers, a number of early women psychologists made important contributions and were acknowledged by some of the men in the growing discipline.</p>

Cattell rated 3 of these women as among the 1,000 most distinguished scientists in the country: Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930), for her analysis of how we learn verbal material and her contributions to self-psychology; Christine Ladd-Franklin (1847–1930), for her work in color vision; and Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) for her pioneering research examining the role of imagery in thought processes and the experimental study of animal cognition. In addition, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected and served as the first female president of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1905, a position also held by Margaret Floy Washburn in 1921. However, because the doors to an academic career remained closed, other early female psychologists found positions in therapeutic and other nonacademic settings; pursued careers in allied professions, such as child development and education, which were considered acceptable fields for women; or gained recognition by collaborating on research projects and books with their spouses.</p>

No doubt some of this progress has resulted from the efforts of teachers of psychology to raise their students’ awareness of the important accomplishments of female psychologists. Because female psychologists perform key research in all of the psychology subfields, you will find their work referred to throughout this text. For example, Terry Amabile has studied creativity, in particular the positive effects that exposure to creative role models can have on people. Elizabeth Loftus’s research on memory has uncovered how unreliable eyewitness accounts of a crime can be. Eleanor Maccoby, Alice Eagly, and Jacqueline Eccles are prominent among the growing number of women and men who are studying sex differences in a variety of areas, such as emotionality, math and verbal ability, and helping behavior.<span class="pagebreak" title="19" id="P7000493190000000000000000000870" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000000870" epub:type="pagebreak"/></p><figure id="P7000493190000000000000000000869" class="figure" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000000869">
