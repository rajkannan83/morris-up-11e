							The following personality inventory is the Short Form for the International Personality Item Pool Represenation of the NEO Pi-R. It will interpret how you rate yourself on a scale that measures how accurately each statement describes you based on a popular trait theory, the Five-Factor Model or Big Five Theory.
							Students will be assessed on five dimensions: extraversion/introversion, agreeablesness/antagonism, conscientiousness/undirectedness, emotional stability/instability, and openness to experience/non-openness.
							Completing the inventory will determine where you fall on each of the five broad personality domains of the Five-Factor Model, and to what degree, relative to your gender and age. Keep in mind that the inventory can only approximate your actual personality.

              <p>What is personality? What are personality traits and trait theories?</p>
              <p>In psychology, personality refers to the style in which we interact with the world, particularly with other people. A trait is a relatively stable disposition to behave in a certain way. <strong>Trait theories</strong> are sets of meaningful and distinct personality dimensions that can be used to describe how people differ from one another.</p>

              <p>There are several trait theories, but one of the most popular is the Five-Factor Model, also knows as the Big Five theory. According to the Big Five theory, we can describe personality by assessing a person’s score on each of five dimensions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>extraversion/introversion</li>
                <li>agreeableness/antagonism</li>
                <li>conscientiousness/undirectedness</li>
                <li>emotional stability/instability</li>
                <li>openness to experience/non-openness</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition, each trait dimension consists of six facets, which correlate with one another. For example, agreeableness correlates with facets such as trust, straightforwardness, and modesty.</p>

              <p>In this activity, you will be completing a personality inventory called the Short Form for the IPIP-NEO (International Personality Item Pool Representation of the NEO PI-R™). In psychology, personality inventories refer to scientifically rigorous questionnaires that ask questions about many different behaviors and assess several traits simultaneously.</p>
              <p>The IPIP-NEO is a public domain inventory that measures the Big Five personality traits. The original IPIP-NEO is assembled by Dr. Lewis R. Goldberg. The short IPIP-NEO was designed to measure exactly the same traits as the original IPIP-NEO but more efficiently and with fewer items. The Short Form for the IPIP-NEO includes scoring and narrative reports created by Dr. John A. Johnson, Professor of Psychology at Penn State University, who has given Pearson permission to reproduce the inventory here.</p>
              <p>Note: The IPIP-NEO is NOT an equivalent of the commercial inventory on which it is based, the NEO PI-R™, authored by Paul T. Costa, Jr. and Robert R. McCrae. The NEO PI-R™ is copyrighted by Psychological Assessment Resources (PAR) in Florida and can only be ordered by professionals and can be used exclusively by permission.</p>

              <p>First a note on terminology: Personality traits describe, relative to
                other people, the frequency or intensity of a person's feelings, thoughts, or behaviors. Possession of a trait is therefore a matter of degree. We might describe two individuals as extraverts but still see one as more extraverted than the other.</p>
              <p>This report uses expressions such as "extravert" or "high in extraversion" to describe someone who is likely to be seen by others as relatively extraverted. The program that generates this report classifies you as low, average, or high in a trait according to whether your score is approximately in the lowest 30%, middle 40%, or highest 30% of scores obtained by people of your gender and roughly your age. Your numerical scores are reported and graphed as percentile estimates. For example, a score of "60" means that your level on that trait is estimated to
                be higher than 60% of persons of your gender and age.</p>

              <p>Please keep in mind that "low," "average," and "high" scores on a personality test are neither good nor bad. A particular level on any trait will probably be neutral or irrelevant for a great many activities, be helpful for accomplishing some things, and be detrimental for accomplishing other things.</p>
              <p>As with any personality inventory, scores and descriptions can only approximate an individual's actual personality. High and low score descriptions are usually accurate, but average scores close to the low or high boundaries might misclassify you as only average. On each set of six sub-domain scales it is somewhat uncommon but certainly possible to score high in some of the sub-domains and low in the others. In such cases more attention should be paid to the sub-domain scores than to the broad domain score. Questions about the accuracy of your results are best resolved by showing your report to people who know you well.</p>

              <p><strong>Extraversion</strong></p>
              <p>Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy being with people, are full of energy, and often experience positive emotions. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented, individuals who are likely to say "Yes!" or "Let's go!" to opportunities for excitement. In groups they like to talk, assert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.</p>
              <p>Introverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of extraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and disengaged from the social world. Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression; the introvert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert and prefers to be alone. The independence and reserve of the introvert is sometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or arrogance. In reality, an introvert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension will not seek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached.</p>

              <p><strong>Agreeableness</strong></p>
              <p>Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy.</p>
              <p>Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.</p>
              <p>Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations that require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.</p>

              <p><strong>Conscientiousness</strong></p>
              <p>Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses. Impulses are not inherently bad; occasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on our first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of play rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be fun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful, fun-to-be-with, and zany.</p>                        <p>Nonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts not only harm other members of society, but also can result in retribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate rewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include excessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job, hurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important relationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually destroy one's health.</p>
              <p>Impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes a person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively disallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which would have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences of steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are therefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.</p>
              <p>A hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings from earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face of short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means both wise and cautious. Persons who score high on the Conscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.</p>
              <p>The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics. Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded as stuffy and boring. Unconscientious people may be criticized for their unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within the lines, but they will experience many short-lived pleasures and they will never be called stuffy.</p>

              <p><strong>Neuroticism</strong></p>
              <p>Freud originally used the term <em>neurosis</em> to describe a condition marked by mental distress, emotional suffering, and an inability to cope effectively with the normal demands of life. He suggested that everyone shows some signs of neurosis, but that we differ in our degree of suffering and our specific symptoms of distress. Today neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings. Those who score high on Neuroticism may experience primarily one specific negative feeling such as anxiety, anger, or depression, but are likely to experience several of these emotions. People high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive. They respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and their reactions tend to be more intense than normal. They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. These problems in emotional regulation can diminish a neurotic's ability to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively with stress.</p>
              <p>At the other end of the scale, individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings; frequency of positive emotions is a component of the Extraversion domain.</p>

              <p><strong>Openness to Experience</strong></p>
              <p>Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people. Open people are intellectually curious, appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be, compared to closed people, more aware of their feelings. They tend to think and act in individualistic and nonconforming ways. Intellectuals typically score high on Openness to Experience; consequently, this factor has also been called <em>Culture</em> or <em>Intellect</em>. Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of openness to experience. Scores on Openness to Experience are only modestly related to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests.</p>
              <p>Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on the individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the many visual or performing arts. People with low scores on openness to experience tend to have narrow, common interests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with suspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use. Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and resistant to change.</p>
              <p>Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who are often themselves open to experience. However, open and closed styles of thinking are useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the open person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed thinking is related to superior job performance in police work, sales, and a number of service occupations.</p>
