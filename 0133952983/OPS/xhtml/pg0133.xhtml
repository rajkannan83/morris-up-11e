<aside class="vignette" id="P7000493190000000000000000005443" data-uri="M13_MORR8923_11_SE_C13.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005443"><p id="P7000493190000000000000000016EC2" data-uri="M13_MORR8923_11_SE_C13.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000016EC2">For most new mothers, giving birth results in an instant bond and feelings of immediate and unconditional love for their new baby. Many describe motherhood as the happiest time in their lives and cannot imagine a life without their children. However, for some, another reaction occurs—one of sadness and apathy, and withdrawal from the world around them. Brooke Shields, the well-known actress and model, was one of these women.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000016EC3" data-uri="M13_MORR8923_11_SE_C13.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000016EC3">In <i>Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression</i>, Shields (2006) writes that she had always dreamed of being a mother. Although she and her husband, Chris Henchy, initially had trouble conceiving, Shields eventually became pregnant through in vitro fertilization and gave birth to a daughter in 2003. Just as her attempt at conceiving wasn’t without effort, easing into life as a mother wasn’t effortless, either.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000016EC4" data-uri="M13_MORR8923_11_SE_C13.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000016EC4">Almost immediately after returning home from the hospital, Shields began to experience symptoms of postpartum depression. Once referred to as the “baby blues,” postpartum depression has recently come to be considered a very legitimate type of depression. Symptoms range from anxiety and tearfulness to feelings of extreme detachment and even being suicidal. Shields notes that her “baby blues” rapidly gave way to full-blown depression, including thoughts of self-harm and frightening visions of harm coming to her baby. In addition to the birth of her child, Shields was also coping with the recent death of her father, as well as the ongoing struggle of coping with the suicide of a close friend two years prior. Doctors note that postpartum depression can be exacerbated by events such as these.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000016EC5" data-uri="M13_MORR8923_11_SE_C13.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000016EC5">As Shields’s mental health began to decline, she felt more anxious and panicky. She felt sadness greater than she’d ever experienced, and began thinking that it would never go away. She felt completely detached from the baby she had gone through so much to have. This detachment depressed her further. It became a vicious cycle, and she suffered tremendously throughout it. It didn’t occur to Shields that she might have postpartum depression until she heard someone comment on the shame and depression associated with the disease. It finally hit home and Shields sought help.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000016EC6" data-uri="M13_MORR8923_11_SE_C13.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000016EC6">As with nearly all forms of depression, there was no quick and easy solution. Treatment requires patience, help from a doctor, a supportive family, and often medication. Shields began treatment and gradually began to feel better. She eventually was able to feel the love that mothers speak of when referring to their children. She bonded with her baby and became tuned in to the child’s needs instinctively. With her doctor’s guidance, she began to wean herself off the medication. She also sought healing through writing the book that detailed her experience, and in 2006, she and her husband conceived again, adding another child to their family.</p>
