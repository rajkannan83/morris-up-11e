These public hospitals, many with beds for thousands of patients, were often built in rural areas in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The idea was that a country setting would calm patients and help to restore their mental health. Despite the good intentions behind the establishment of these hospitals, in general they have not provided adequate care or therapy for their residents, as they are perpetually underfunded and understaffed. Except for new arrivals who were often intensively treated in the hope of quickly discharging them, patients received little therapy besides drugs; and most spent their days watching television or staring into space. Under these conditions, many patients became completely apathetic and accepted a permanent “sick role.”</p>

First, people who were agitated could now be sedated with drugs, which was considered an improvement over the use of physical restraints. The second major, and more lasting, result of the new drug therapies was the widespread release of people with severe psychological disorders back into the community—a policy called <a class="xref" data-href="#P700049319000000000000000000581A"><?citation type="sn" Left="MN1" Right="MN1" idref="ch13mn26"?></a><a class="keyword" id="P7000493190000000000000000005819" data-uri="M13_MORR8923_11_SE_C13.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005819" epub:type="keyword" href="pg0166.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000006A21"><?REGION x="252.196" y="267.180" w="92.348" h="9.500" page="474" pagename="474"?>deinstitutionalization</a>.</p>

Discharged people often find poorly funded community mental health centers—or none at all. Many are not prepared to live in the community and they receive little guidance in coping with the mechanics of daily life. Those who return home can become a burden to their families, especially when follow-up care is inadequate. The quality of residential centers such as halfway houses can vary, with many providing poor care and minimal contact with the outside world. Insufficient sheltered housing forces many former patients into nonpsychiatric facilities—often rooming houses located in dirty, unsafe, isolated neighborhoods. The patients are further burdened by the social stigma of mental illness, which may be the largest single obstacle to their rehabilitation. Many released patients have been unable to obtain follow-up care or housing and are incapable of looking after their own needs. Consequently, many have ended up literally on the streets. Without supervision, they have stopped taking the drugs that made their release possible in the first place and their psychotic symptoms have returned. Perhaps one of the most tragic outcomes of the deinstitutionalization movement is the increase in the suicide rate among deinstitutionalized patients (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007664"><?REGION x="272.108" y="573.180" w="61.891" h="9.500" page="474" pagename="474"?>Goldney, 2003</a>).

All alternatives involved daily professional contact and skillful preparation of the community to receive the patients.

For example, there are programs designed to help mothers encourage problem-solving skills in their children and programs to enhance competence and adjustment among elderly persons. Current campaigns to educate young people about drugs, alcohol abuse, violence, and date rape are examples of primary prevention (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000075B1"><?REGION x="377.008" y="407.180" w="36.992" h="9.500" page="475" pagename="475"?>Foxcroft, <?REGION x="54.000" y="419.180" w="143.971" h="9.500" page="475" pagename="475"?>Ireland, Lister, Lowe, &amp; Breen, 2003</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007EAB"><?REGION x="207.471" y="419.180" w="105.230" h="9.500" page="475" pagename="475"?>Schinke &amp; Schwinn, 2005</a>).</p>

For example, hospitals often grant passes to encourage people to leave the institution for short periods of time before their release. Other tertiary prevention measures are halfway houses, where people find support and skills training during the period of transition between hospitalization and full integration into the community, and nighttime and outpatient programs that provide supportive therapy while people live at home and hold down full-time jobs. Tertiary prevention also includes community education.</p>
