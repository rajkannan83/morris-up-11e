We refrain from playing music at full volume when our neighbors are sleeping, comply with jury notices received in the mail, and obey traffic signals even when no one is on the road to enforce them. We now turn to processes that <i>do</i> depend on the presence of others. Specifically, we examine processes that occur when people interact one-on-one and in groups. One of these social actions is called <i>deindividuation.</i> </p>

The most striking and frightening instance of this phenomenon is <i>mob behavior.</i> Some well-known violent examples of mob behavior are the looting that sometimes accompanies urban rioting and the wanton destruction of property that mars otherwise peaceful protests and demonstrations. One reason for mob behavior is that people can lose their personal sense of responsibility in a group, especially in a group subjected to intense pressures and anxiety. This process is called <a class="xref" data-href="#P7000493190000000000000000005D4A"><?citation type="sn" Left="MN1" Right="MN1" idref="ch14mn26"?></a><a class="keyword" id="P7000493190000000000000000005D49" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005D49" epub:type="keyword" href="pg0166.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000006A1E"><?REGION x="198.052" y="347.803" w="71.420" h="9.500" page="507" pagename="507"?>deindividuation</a> because people respond not as individuals, but as anonymous parts of a larger group. In general, the more anonymous that people feel in a group, the less responsible they feel as individuals (Aronson, Wilson, &amp; Akert, 2005; <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000081EC"><?REGION x="157.111" y="383.803" w="67.988" h="9.500" page="507" pagename="507"?>Zimbardo, 2007</a>). But deindividuation only partly explains mob behavior. Another contributing factor is that, in a group, one dominant and persuasive person can convince people to act through a <i>snowball effect:</i> If the persuader convinces just a few people, those few will convince others, who will convince still others, and the group becomes an unthinking mob.

In the bathroom of a bus station, he was attacked and beaten to death. Several people were within earshot and heard his cries for help, but none of them helped him or called the police. One person saw him lying on the floor in a pool of blood, but he did nothing. Another person saw him struggling to breathe, but he also walked away. Eventually, a 12-year-old boy called for help. The police arrived in less than 20 seconds, but it was too late to save Kevin’s life.</p>

In the business world, key decisions are often made around a conference table rather than behind one person’s desk. In politics, major policy decisions are seldom vested in just one person. In the courts, a defendant may request a trial by jury, and for some serious crimes, jury trial is required by law.

Polarization begins when group members discover during discussion that they share views to a greater degree than they realized. Then, in an effort to be seen in a positive light by the others, at least some group members become strong advocates for what is potentially the dominant sentiment in the group. Arguments leaning toward one extreme or the other not only reassure people that their initial attitudes are correct, but they also intensify those attitudes so that the group as a whole becomes more extreme in its position (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007A4C"><?REGION x="292.626" y="567.180" w="100.632" h="9.500" page="509" pagename="509"?>J.

In fact, groups are more effective than individuals only under certain circumstances. For one thing, their success depends on the task they face. If the requirements of the task match the skills of the group members, the group is likely to be more effective than any single individual. However, even if task and personnel are perfectly matched, the ways in which group members <i>interact</i> may reduce the group’s efficiency. For example, high-status individuals tend to exert more influence in groups, so if they do not possess the best problem-solving skills, group decisions may suffer (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007A68"><?REGION x="282.607" y="741.180" w="131.393" h="9.500" page="509" pagename="509"?>Lovaglia, Mannix, Samuelson, <span class="pagebreak" title="510" id="P7000493190000000000000000005D9E" data-uri="M14_MORR8923_11_SE_C14.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005D9E" epub:type="pagebreak"/><?REGION x="198.000" y="51.180" w="83.258" h="9.500" page="510" pagename="510"?>Sell, &amp; Wilson, 2005</a>). Another factor affecting group interaction and effectiveness is group size. The larger the group, the more likely it is to include someone who has the skills needed to solve a difficult problem. On the other hand, it is much harder to coordinate the activities of a large group. In addition, large groups may be more likely to encourage <i>social loafing,</i> the tendency of group members to exert less individual effort on the assumption that others in the group will do the work (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007B84"><?REGION x="201.258" y="123.180" w="73.271" h="9.500" page="510" pagename="510"?>J.

When the people in a group like one another and feel committed to the goals of the group, cohesiveness is high. Under these conditions, members may work hard for the group, spurred by high morale. But cohesiveness can undermine the quality of group decision making.

Dr. King was clearly a “great person”—intelligent, dynamic, eloquent, and highly motivated.

One kind of leader is <i>task oriented,</i> concerned with doing the task well—even at the expense of worsening relationships among group members. Other leaders are <i>relationship oriented,</i> concerned with maintaining group cohesiveness and harmony. Which style is most effective depends on three sets of situational factors. One is the nature of the task (whether it is clearly structured or ambiguous).

According to Sternberg, creativity is necessary to devise new ideas, intelligence to evaluate and implement ideas, and wisdom to balance the interests of everyone involved (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007FBA"><?REGION x="243.267" y="243.180" w="65.531" h="9.500" page="511" pagename="511"?>Sternberg, 2007</a>).

Yet, it is not the only approach to leadership. In a collectivist culture that values cooperation and interdependence among group members, although one member may be named “the manager,” it is less likely that individuals will have clearly defined roles as “this type of leader” or “that type of leader.” All members see themselves as working together to accomplish the group’s goals.</p>

This approach emphasizes decision-making input from all group members, small work teams that promote close cooperation, and a leadership style in which managers receive much the same treatment as any other employee. In the West, it is not uncommon for executives to have their own parking spaces, dining facilities, and fitness and social clubs, as well as separate offices and independent schedules. Most Japanese executives consider this privileged style of management very strange. In many Eastern cultures, managers and executives share the same facilities as their workers, hunt for parking spaces like everyone else, and eat and work side by side with their employees. It is interesting that the Japanese model has effectively combined the two leadership approaches—task oriented and relationship oriented—into a single overall style. By being a part of the group, the leader can simultaneously work toward and direct the group’s goals, while also contributing to the group’s morale and social climate.</p>
