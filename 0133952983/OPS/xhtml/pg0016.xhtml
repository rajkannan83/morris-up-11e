In a typical session, a young man would arrive at the laboratory to participate. He was met by a stern-faced researcher in a lab coat; another man in street clothes was sitting in the waiting room. The researcher explained that he was studying the effects of punishment on learning. When the two men drew slips out of the hat, the participant’s slip said “teacher.” The teacher watched as the “learner” was strapped into a chair and an electrode attached to his wrist. Then the teacher was taken into an adjacent room and seated at an impressive-looking “shock generator” with switches from 15 to 450 volts (V), labeled “Slight Shock,” “Very Strong Shock,” up to “Danger: Severe Shock,” and, finally, “XXX.” The teacher’s job was to read a list of paired words, which the learner would attempt to memorize and repeat. The teacher was instructed to deliver a shock whenever the learner gave a wrong answer and to increase the intensity of the shock each time the learner made a mistake. At 90 V, the learner began to grunt; at 120 V, he shouted, “Hey, this really hurts!” At 150 V, he demanded to be released, and at 270 V, his protests became screams of agony. Beyond 330 V, the learner appeared to pass out. If the teacher became concerned and asked whether he could stop, the experimenter politely but firmly replied that he was expected to continue, that this experiment was being conducted in the interest of science.</p>

He wanted to find out whether ordinary people would obey orders to cause another person pain. As part of his research, <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007B7E"><?REGION x="264.306" y="315.180" w="65.076" h="9.500" page="32" pagename="32"?>Milgram (1974)</a> described the experiment to 110 psychiatrists, college students, and middle-class adults, and he asked them at what point they thought participants would stop. Members of all three groups guessed that most people would refuse to continue beyond 130 V and that no one would go beyond 300 V. The psychiatrists estimated that only one in a thousand people would continue to the XXX shock panel. Astonishingly, 65% of Milgram’s participants administered the highest level of shock, even though many worried aloud that the shocks might be causing serious damage to the learners.</p>
<p id="P7000493190000000000000000013E1E" data-uri="M01_MORR8923_11_SE_C01.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000013E1E">To find out what he wanted to know, Milgram had to deceive his participants. The stated purpose of the experiment—to test learning—was a lie. The “learners” were Milgram’s accomplices, who had been trained to act as though they were being hurt; the machines were fake; and the learners received no shocks at all (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007B7C"><?REGION x="518.737" y="447.180" w="39.263" h="9.500" page="32" pagename="32"?>Milgram, <?REGION x="198.000" y="459.180" w="14.335" h="9.500" page="32" pagename="32"?>1963</a>). But, critics argued, the “teachers”—the real subjects of the study—were hurt. Not only did most voice concern, but also they showed clear signs of stress: They sweated, bit their lips, trembled, stuttered, or in a few cases, broke into uncontrollable nervous laughter. Critics also worried about the effect of the experiment on the participants’ self-esteem. How would you like to be compared with the people who ran the death camps in Nazi Germany? (In <a class="xref" href="pg0144.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000005A01"><?REGION x="384.002" y="519.180" w="46.751" h="9.500" page="32" pagename="32"?><span class="label">Chapter </span><span class="number">14</span></a>, “Social Psychology,” we will describe a 2009 study that attempted to replicate the Milgram study without raising the same ethical concerns.)</p>

A new code of ethics on psychological experimentation was approved. The code is assessed each year and periodically revised to ensure that it adequately protects participants in research studies. In addition to outlining the ethical principles guiding research and teaching, the code spells out a set of ethical standards for psychologists who offer therapy and other professional services, such as psychological testing.</p>

Failure to abide by these federal regulations may result in the termination of federal funding for the researcher and penalties for the research institution.</p>

Some people contend that research procedures should never be emotionally or physically distressing. Others assert that ethical guidelines that are too strict may undermine the scientific value of research or cripple future research. Still others maintain that psychology, as a science, should base its ethical code on documented evidence about the effects of research procedures on participants, not on conjecture about what is “probably” a good way to conduct research. Yet another view is that developing the explanations necessary to produce informed consent may help researchers themselves get a better understanding of the goals and methods of research.</p>

Psychologists study animal behavior to shed light on human behavior. Crowding mice into small cages, for example, has yielded valuable insights into the effects of overcrowding on humans. Animals are used in experiments in which it would be clearly unethical to use human participants—such as studies involving brain lesions (requiring cutting into the brain). In fact, much of what we know about sensation, perception, drugs, emotional attachment, and the neural basis of behavior is derived from animal research (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007DDC"><?REGION x="379.582" y="446.580" w="34.418" h="9.500" page="33" pagename="33"?>Ringach <?REGION x="54.000" y="458.580" w="59.132" h="9.500" page="33" pagename="33"?>&amp; Jentsch, 2009</a>).
