Skeels found evidence in the 1930s that IQ scores among children also depend on environmental stimulation. While investigating orphanages for the state of Iowa, Skeels observed that the children lived in very overcrowded wards and that the few adults there had almost no time to play with the children, to talk to them, or to read them stories. Many of these children were classified as “subnormal” in intelligence. Skeels followed the cases of two girls who, after 18 months in an orphanage, were sent to a ward for women with severe intellectual disabilities. Originally, the girls’ IQs were in the range of disability, but after a year on the adult ward, as if by magic, their IQs had risen to normal (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007F48"><?REGION x="472.932" y="562.180" w="50.509" h="9.500" page="254" pagename="254"?>Skeels, 1938</a>). Skeels regarded this fact as quite remarkable—after all, the women with whom the girls had lived were themselves severely retarded. When he placed 13 other “slow” children as houseguests in such adult wards, within 18 months their mean IQ rose from 64 to 92 (within the normal range)—all apparently because they had had someone (even someone of below-normal intelligence) to play with them, to read to them, to cheer them on when they took their first steps, and to encourage them to talk (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007F4A"><?REGION x="529.292" y="634.180" w="28.708" h="9.500" page="254" pagename="254"?>Skeels, <?REGION x="198.000" y="646.180" w="14.335" h="9.500" page="254" pagename="254"?>1942</a>). During the same period, the mean IQ of a group of children who had been left in orphanages dropped from 86 to 61.

For 6 years, the children whose mothers received special training spent most of each day in an infant-education center, where they were fed, taught, and cared for by paraprofessionals.

Ultimately the children in the experimental group achieved an average IQ score of 126, 51 points higher than their mothers’ average scores. In contrast, the average score of the children in the control group was 94. Thus, this landmark study supported the notion that intervention may indeed counter the negative effects of cultural and socioeconomic deprivation on IQ scores.</p>

A useful analogy comes from studies of plants. Suppose that you grow one group of randomly assigned plants in enriched soil, and another group in poor soil. The enriched group will grow to be taller and stronger than the nonenriched group; the difference between the two groups in this case is due entirely to differences in their environment. <i>Within</i> each group of plants, however, differences among individual plants are likely to be primarily due to genetics, because all plants in the same group share essentially the same environment. Thus, the height and strength of any single plant reflects both heredity <i>and</i> environment.</p>

At the same time, the IQ scores of particular people would reflect the effects of both heredity <i>and</i> environment. Robert Plomin, an influential researcher in the field of human intelligence, concludes that “the world’s literature suggests that about half of the total variance in IQ scores can be accounted for by genetic variance” (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007D4F"><?REGION x="452.637" y="111.180" w="54.240" h="9.500" page="256" pagename="256"?>Plomin, 1997</a>, p. 89).

They found no differences between males and females in most of the studies they examined. However, a few differences did appear in cognitive abilities: Girls tended to display greater verbal ability, and boys tended to exhibit stronger spatial and mathematical abilities.

At that time, the American students at both grade levels lagged far behind the other two countries in math and came in second in reading. A decade later, when the study was repeated with a new group of fifth-graders, the researchers discovered that the American students performed even worse than they had earlier. In 1990, the research team also studied the original first-graders from all three cultures, now in the eleventh grade. The result? The American students retained their low standing in mathematics compared with the Asian students (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007FC8"><?REGION x="120.869" y="537.180" w="65.293" h="9.500" page="257" pagename="257"?>Stevenson, 1992</a>, <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007FCB"><?REGION x="190.741" y="537.180" w="18.658" h="9.500" page="257" pagename="257"?>1993</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007FCD"><?REGION x="213.978" y="537.180" w="120.696" h="9.500" page="257" pagename="257"?>Stevenson, Chen, &amp; Lee, 1993</a>).<a id="P700049319000000000000000000329A" data-href="#P700049319000000000000000000329B" data-uri="M07_MORR8923_11_SE_C07.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000329A"/> </p><aside class="sidebar" id="P700049319000000000000000000329B" data-uri="M07_MORR8923_11_SE_C07.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000329B"><header><h1 class="title" id="P700049319000000000000000000329C" data-uri="M07_MORR8923_11_SE_C07.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000329C" epub:type="title"><span class="pagebreak" title="258" id="P700049319000000000000000000329D" data-uri="M07_MORR8923_11_SE_C07.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000000329D" epub:type="pagebreak"/><span class="label">Thinking Critically About … </span>

Stevenson’s team wondered whether cultural attitudes toward ability and effort might, in part, explain the differences. To test this hypothesis, the researchers asked students, their parents, and their teachers in all three countries whether they thought effort or ability had a greater impact on academic performance. From first through eleventh grade, American students on the whole disagreed with the statement that “everyone in my class has about the same natural ability in math.” In other words, the Americans thought that “studying hard” has little to do with performance. Their responses appear to reflect a belief that mathematical skill is primarily a function of innate ability. American mothers expressed a similar view. Moreover, 41% of the American eleventh-grade teachers thought “innate intelligence” is the most important factor in mathematics performance. By contrast, Asian students, parents, and teachers believed that effort and “studying hard” determine success in math.</p>
<p id="P700049319000000000000000001589A" data-uri="M07_MORR8923_11_SE_C07.xhtml#P700049319000000000000000001589A">Such culturally influenced views of the relative importance of effort and innate ability may have profound consequences for the way that children, their parents, and their teachers approach the task of learning. Students who believe that learning is based on natural ability see little value in working hard to learn a difficult subject. By contrast, students who believe that academic success comes from studying are more likely to work hard. Indeed, even the brightest students will not get far without making an effort. Although many Americans no doubt believe in the value of effort and hard work, our widespread perception that innate ability is the key to academic success may be affecting the performance of U.S. students.</p>

They defined giftedness in terms of academic talent and measured it by an IQ score in the top 2 percentile (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000008031"><?REGION x="412.409" y="75.180" w="55.348" h="9.500" page="260" pagename="260"?>Terman, 1925</a>). The study involved 1,528 children whose average IQ score was 151. More recently, some experts have sought to broaden the definition of giftedness beyond that of simply high IQ (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007380"><?REGION x="491.842" y="99.180" w="66.158" h="9.500" page="260" pagename="260"?>L.

One view is that giftedness is often an interaction of above-average general intelligence, exceptional creativity, and high levels of commitment. Various criteria can identify gifted students, including scores on intelligence tests, teacher recommendations, and achievement test results. School systems generally use diagnostic testing, interviews, and evaluation of academic and creative work (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P7000493190000000000000000007E7F"><?REGION x="398.074" y="171.180" w="49.612" h="9.500" page="260" pagename="260"?>Sattler, 1992</a>). These selection methods can identify students with a broad range of talent, but they can miss students with specific abilities, such as a talent for mathematics or music (<a class="biblioref" href="pg0167.xhtml#P70004931900000000000000000073CE"><?REGION x="430.187" y="195.180" w="92.999" h="9.500" page="260" pagename="260"?>Cramond &amp; Kim, 2008</a>).

Special classes for the gifted would seem to be something the gifted themselves would want, but this is not always the case. Special classes and special schools can separate gifted students from their friends and neighbors. And stereotypes about the gifted can mean that, once identified as gifted, the student is less likely to be invited to participate in certain school activities, such as dances, plays, and sports. Gifted students also sometimes object to being set apart, labeled “brains,” and pressured to perform beyond the ordinary. Many but not all gifted students welcome the opportunities offered by special programs.</p></aside>
